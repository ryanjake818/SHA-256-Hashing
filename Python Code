'''Hashing Files Assignment'''
# Jake Ryan
# 1. Ask the user which folder contains the files to be hashed
# 2. Ask the user which folder do you want the hashes to be stored
# 3. User proof your code
#   a. User provides a valid folder to obtain files to hash
#   b. User hash folder exists or if it does not exist, create the directory
# 6. The hashes will be SHA-256
# 7. SHA-256.CSV will be the name of the file storing the hashes
# 8. Your script will be named lastname_firstname_hashme.py
