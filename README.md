# SHA-256-Hashing
Creating a script to hash all files in a directory for CFRS-510
Assingment criteria were as follows:
 1. Ask the user which folder contains the files to be hashed
 2. Ask the user which folder do you want the hashes to be stored
 3. User proof your code:
      - User provides a valid folder to obtain files to hash
      - User hash folder exists or if it does not exist, create the directory
 6. The hashes will be SHA-256
 7. SHA-256.CSV will be the name of the file storing the hashes
 8. Your script will be named lastname_firstname_hashme.py
 
 This script can be used to hash any files in a directory. The SHA-256 can be changed to any other hashing algorithm.
